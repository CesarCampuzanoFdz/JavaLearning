To create a sprong project, I go to:
https://start.spring.io/

Chose the defaults to start,
In group, name the project like com.<packagename> and name it in Name
Click generate, and extract that zip where wanted the project.

In eclipse, File-> Import -> Existing Maven Project and choose the folder that I have extracted.
Select the pom.xml and wait to the import done.

Once the downloads have been completed:
In src/main/java, in the package name before, a java file is present and ready to be executed.
